Eminem sold more albums in 2018 than any other artist, data shows.

The US rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, sold 755,027 albums during the year compared to runner-up K-Pop group BTS who sold over 150,000 less albums across the same period.

But only a chunk of Eminem's sales were thanks to his latest album Kamikaze. The album finished as the fourth biggest selling album of the year, accounting for half of the rapper's 2018 sales.

It seems the 46-year-old's previous albums - the most popular of which was The Marshall Mathers in 2000 - were so successful that fans are still buying them to this day.

In the list of top album sales by artists, Eminem was followed by other classics such as Metallica, The Beatles, Queen and Justin Timberlake - artists and groups who have maintained popularity over an extended period of time.

Slim Shady managed to rack up over 2.5 billion streams throughout last year, of which only 760 million were for his latest album. He also broke YouTube records with his track 'Kill Shot' dissing Machine Gun Kelly - who didn't get a mention in the data. 

Post Malone came out on top as the top artist by consumption, followed by the late XXXTentacion, and then Eminem. Travis Scott came in next, followed by Migos, J Cole and Kendrick Lamar, respectively.

No female artists made it into the top 10. Taylor Swift came in at number 11 followed by Ariana Grande, with rapper Cardi B coming in at number 18.
